A Program built based on Minimum viable product or MVP (as stated in project specification):

getting details of restaurants that meet the user's specified requirements. (Give a list of restaurants based on 
location, distance from the location, and price and then order based on reviews and how well they fit those parameters).

The current Prototype enables the user to enter a location, distance, and price range. It then outputs a list of 
restaurants based on these parameters and orders them based on review ratings. Although not part of the MVP Further 
Prototypes will implement an interactive GUI interface that allows the user to add restaurants they like to a 
Randomizer.

TO RUN:

1). Run GUI_Main file.
2). Enter City or Postcode into location box
3). Enter Distance in miles (max 25) in distance box
4). Select Price range from dropdown box
5). Click submit button
6). Results will appear in console.

Unfortunately, I was unable to get the results onto the GUI screen so its only available in the console.
I have still achieved my MVP as I only need to get the results of restaurants based on the user requirements.

--------------------------------------------

(IF GUI_MAIN DOESN'T RUN FOLLOW THESE STEPS)

--------------------------------------------
1). Run main.py file.
2). Enter Location (can be a city or postcode).
3). Enter Distance in miles (radius around the location to search for restaurants)
4). Enter a number between 1-4 to get price range (will show price up to one selected, e.g 3 will show £,££,£££
5). Output shows a list of 20 restaurants details based on user requirements ordered by review ratings.
